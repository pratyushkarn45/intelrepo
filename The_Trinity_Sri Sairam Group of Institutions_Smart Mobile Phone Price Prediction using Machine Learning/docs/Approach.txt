Approach for Smart Mobile Phone Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm:


Step 1: Data Collection

Gather a comprehensive dataset of smart mobile phone attributes and their corresponding prices.
Include features such as brand, model, display size, RAM, storage capacity, camera quality, processor, battery capacity, etc.
Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of different mobile phone models and price ranges.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Normalize numerical features to a common scale to prevent bias in the model.
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Step 3: Feature Selection

Analyze the importance of features using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance algorithms.
Select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the price prediction task.
Remove any redundant or irrelevant features that may negatively impact model performance.

Step 4: Model Training and Evaluation

Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70:30 ratio).
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression, such as logistic regression, decision tree regression,KNN classification,SVM classifer with linear & RBF kernel and random forest regression.

Train the selected model using the training set and optimize its hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search.

Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy score,mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (MSE), or R-squared score & Median.
Repeat steps 4-5 with different algorithms to compare their performance and choose the best-performing model.
